    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",

    "Ans.\n",
    "Abstraction: \"What to show?\"\n",
    "Definition: Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.It helps you focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

It hides the internal state of the object from the outside world. Achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public."
